# Disable Google Search Video Player

This extension will disable the embedded popup player within Google when a Youtube video's thumbnail is selected.

This works by replacing every embedded link to the original video's link.

## How to install
- Download the .zip file from the releases section
- Go to your Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/)
- Enable 'Developer Mode'
- Drag the .zip file directly onto the extensions page
